## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5 (grid system & components)
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Things I learned from this project are:

- Building a responsive hero section with an interactive image slider that supports previous/next navigation.

- Syncing dynamic text content with image slides while preserving layout integrity.

- Handling keyboard accessibility: ensuring buttons and interactive elements are focusable and visible across desktop and mobile.

- Using Bootstrap’s grid and utility classes while overriding default styles for custom layout and button behavior.

- Implementing smooth slide transitions and visually appealing focus states for interactive elements.

- Using modern CSS techniques like clamp() to create fluid, responsive spacing and typography without relying solely on media queries.

### Continued development

Features I wish to add/learn about in the future:

- Advanced accessibility techniques, like managing focus states across complex interactive components and ensuring keyboard & screen reader usability in all layouts.

- Creating smooth, dynamic animations that feel natural and polished.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) - Referenced to implement the responsive grid layout, utility classes, navbar and carousel components.
